  {
    keys: ["live", "stay", "dublin", "ireland", "location", "based", "current"],
    answer: "Lakshmi currently lives in Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪, where she's doing her doctoral research at UCD. Her husband is also in Ireland, so she has some family around. But her parents are back in Kerala — and she carries Kerala in her heart (and her movie dialogues!) everywhere she goes. 🌍"

She also loves TV series like Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and Modern Family. And thanks to her husband, she's gotten into Marvel movies too. Romance novels? Nah, she's over those. But a good thriller novel? Sign her up! 📚🍿"

  {
    keys: ["mental health", "anxiety", "anxious", "struggle", "difficult", "imposter", "syndrome", "challenge", "tough", "hard time"],
    answer: "Lakshmi is really open about her journey. She describes herself as a hugely anxious person, and she's faced real mental health challenges — especially during her college years in India. Those experiences were triggering for a long time, but she's grown through them. She also deals with imposter syndrome during her PhD, but she pushes through because research is her passion. Her honesty about these struggles makes her incredibly strong. 💛"
  },
  {
    keys: ["personality", "kind of person", "describe", "character", "trait", "empathy", "empathetic", "spiritual"],
    answer: "Lakshmi is highly empathetic — sometimes too much, she says, and it gets her into trouble! 😅 She's also quite anxious but incredibly resilient. She's a deeply spiritual person and someone who wears her heart on her sleeve. She's warm, real, and not afraid to be vulnerable. Also, she can drop a Malayalam movie dialogue at any moment — consider yourself warned! 🌸"
  },
  {
    keys: ["age", "old", "year"],
    answer: "Lakshmi is currently 28 years old! 🎂 Young, driven, and already on her way to a PhD — not bad at all!"

  },
  {
    keys: ["advice", "tip", "recommendation", "suggest", "inspire", "inspiration"],
    answer: "While I can't give advice on Lakshmi's behalf, I can tell you she's someone who's overcome a LOT — mental health struggles, imposter syndrome, moving across countries. If there's one thing her story teaches, it's resilience! 💪"

  },
  {
    keys: ["friend", "friends", "friendship"],
